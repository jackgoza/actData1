/*
Name:	Jack Goza, Joshua Ford, Scott Peery
Course:	CS303
Program:	Project 1A
Due Date:	

Description: This is an assignment tracker. It reads in a file as well as takes 
input from a menu based GUI. It will track the number of assignments in three ways. 
1. assigned, 2. completed, 3. completed/uncompleted assignments that are late.
The GUI will allow the user to read in a txt file of assignments and status: this 
includes dates assigned, due, description, and status. The menus will also allow
the user to do the following:
1. add new assignment
2. complete an assignment
3. edit the assignment due date
4. edit the assignment description
5. output number of assignments due
6. output number of assignments late
7. output assignments due in descending order
8. output assignments late in descending order
The output on screen will be as follows:
<date due>, <description>, <date assigned>, <assignment status>
ex: 2-11-2015, linked lists, 2-2-2-15, late

Inputs: Will read in a txt file into a doubly linked list

Outputs: Will output to original txt file, updating and over writing to reflect
changes made. i.e.- new assignments added, assignments completed, assignments late.

Algorithm:

Check that input file exists
Read in file
Check data before adding to lists
Throw exception and handle if bad info
Assign data read to doubly linked list
while reading in data, put in descending order
	this will make searching by date easier as well as adding
	new assignments in the correct order maximizing efficiency
Close file
Do this at opening of program every time to ensure any additions or
	changes are included for the user
Create menu based GUI
	Use switch case to handle choices

Write to file(Update function)
Open file for writing ONLY when output function called
Close file when completed
This will update and overwrite previous file with the lists in descending order,
allowing an O(n) efficiency when imported the next time.
